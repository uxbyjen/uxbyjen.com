## Remote Testing

The majority of studies I currently work on for clients are remote studies. I excel in analysis and creating deliverable for these types of studies, providing deliverables including usability findings by severity, participant highlight reels, and recommendations based on best practices and design and usablity principles. 

I have tested both desktop and mobile experiences using remote testing, ranging from live sites to apps to prototypes of varitying fidelity. 

I also prefer remote testing for most usablity sessions. This testing formating has become easier and more cost effective as many participants have become more familiar and comfortable using web conferencing software (such as Zoom) since the pandemic. It also allows for a much further reach for recruiting and lets participants join testing sessions from the comfort of their own homes or workplaces on their own devices. I feel that this creates a more real-world experience than in-lab testing. 

## In-lab Testing

I have experience in a variety of in-lab testing methodologies for both desktop and mobile devices as well as facilitating card sorts, concept and wireframe walk-throughs, and focus groups. 

This setup also often asks for clients from differnet departments in a company to come togther (usually in one viewing room) to watch these sesions. I have found that this often allows problem-solving disuccions for clients that they may  otherwise not have the oppurtunity to have. I have also observed that watching live sessions with particiapnts right on the other side of one-way mirrors prompts stronger emotional responese and impact with clients when they can view thier users struggling with thier site or software realtime. 

While I enjoy in-lab sessions with participants and clients, I believe remote testing provides more naturalistic data. 

## Eye-tracking

I have several years experience using the Tobii eye-tracking hardware and software to run eye-tracking studies for current state sites as well as prototypes. These sessions were most commonly part of larger usability tests to help identity possible design pain points and inform concept and prototypes designs with participants. 

## International Studies

I have collaborated on a number of international studies for Fortune 500 companies with international markets in countries such as: China, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Germany, and France. 

Many of thest tests were conduced in the naive language with a local moderator and a translator was hired to provide real-time translation. I was responsible for the analysis and delivery of the report, clips, and recommendations.
