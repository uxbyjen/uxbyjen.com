## Teaching

### Youth instructor 

I enjoy teaching and have taught a variety of ages in multiple settings. I started in my teens teaching 3-5 year olds introduction to dance at a local dance studio. I also assisted teaching horseback riding during several youth summer camps at a small horse ranch. 

### TA/Instructor 

As I as completing my Master’s degree, I had the oppurtunity to be a teaching assitant in the College of Engineering at the University of Washington. I taught my own class for around 20-30 engineering students (depending on the quarter). This was an introductory technical writing course that was required for all engineering undergrads. 

While there were sample lesson plans and accompanying resources, I was encouraged to customize each lesson plans to adjust to my evolving teaching style and to the needs of each class of students. I graded and provided feedback on student assignments and tests above and beyond what was required to help ensure my students had the best opportunity to be successful in my class.  

## Volunteer Work

For the majority of my teen year I volunteered as a camp counselor every July at a dance and art camp for outreach and underprivileged youth. In my late teens, this volunteer work transited into a paid position for several summers as the head counselor where I trained and managed junior volunteer counselors, assisted in the day-to-day running of the came, and provided support for teachers.   

## Waitressing 

While working towards my Associate’s degree at Bellevue Community Collage (now Bellevue College), I worked as a waitress at a family-run Japanese. I learned a lot about customer service, how to manage many tasks at once, and was required to learn the names of many sushi types and dishes in both English and Japanese.
