I am a usability, user experience, and user research professional as well as a passionate user advocate. 

I have worked as a consultant and researcher for over a decade on more than five hundred studies ranging from one-on-one participant interviews to focus groups to concept testing/exploration.

The clients I have collaborated has included ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies, B2B websites and services, to online software providers. Some example industries included: 

* computers and techonolgy   
* payroll and HR services
* online education services
* domestic and international shipping
* nonprofits
* cosmetics and personal care
* couponing and deals sites
* debt consolidation and support services
* healthcare providers
* B2B
* and more....

My focus is on qualitative research as I find this methodology to be rich in behavioral data and user stories that provide insights into user motivations, decision-making, emotion, expectations, and mental models.
