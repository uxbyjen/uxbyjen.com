            <div class="content">
                <p>One of the most frustrating things I hear from users who are struggling with a site is when they blame themselves for the problems they're experiencing. They assume it's "user error" and that there must be something wrong with the way they're thinking or using the site. This leads to comments like "I just can't seem to figure this out…am I missing something? I’m starting to feel stupid.”</p>
                <p>But I don’t believe in user error. When people resign their inability to complete tasks on a website or online experiences to users error, it’s a sign that the site or experience is not doing its job properly. It is either unclear, unresponsive to user needs, or simply failing in some fundamental way that not only is potentially losing customers, but making them feel bad.</p>
                <p>An online experience should never leave its users feeling annoyed, frustrated, or stupid. It's the website that needs to be intuitive, user-friendly, and effective. It’s time to let go of this idea of user error and focus on what users are really saying.</p>

                        <p>Curated from hundreds of participant interactions, complaints, and suggestions gathered during extensive usability tests, the Pocket Participant, sheds light on the most common participant comments when shopping online.</p>
                        <p>Drawing from a wide range of ecommerce sites, including retail, shipping, healthcare, and technology (just to name a few), certain themes and user comments recur with striking consistency. These recurring issues may seem obvious in hindsight, but they persist across all types of e-commerce platforms.</p>
                        <p>They deserve increased attention, and that is where the Pocket Participant comes in. This practical handbook examines these most commonly recurring participant comments, highlighting areas that consistently frustrate and annoy users, with the aim of improving online shopping experiences.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>As a seasoned usability and user research professional, I'm passionate about advocating for users and making their interactions with websites and digital products as intuitive as possible.</p>
                <p>Throughout more than 15 years as a usability professional, I've had the opportunity to work on over 500 projects across various industries, conducting a wide range of studies from one-on-one interviews to focus groups and concept testing. My experience spans businesses of all sizes and types, from startups to Fortune 500 companies.</p>
                <p>As a qualitative research specialist, I've come to appreciate the richness of behavioral data as a means to gather invaluable insights into user motivations, decision-making processes, emotions, expectations, and mental models.</p>
                <p>Most recently, I've worked as a consultant, collaborating with companies to conduct usability and user research studies across various platforms (websites and apps) for online retailers, B2B websites and services, SaaS, deal sites, travel services, debt consolidation, online education, and nonprofits (just to name a few).</p>
                <p>These experiences have equipped me with a deep understanding of user needs and behaviors, which I strive to share with companies to help them meet their customers’ needs.</p>
